<h1>Temporal Data</h1>
Temporal data is data that changes over time, or data that has an associated time component. This time component can be either explicit (i.e., the data explicitly contains time information) or implicit (i.e., the time information is inferred from the context in which the data is used). Temporal data is often used in applications where tracking changes over time is important, such as in financial systems, medical records, and scientific research.

<h1>Temporal Databases</h1>
A temporal database is a database that is designed to handle temporal data. Temporal databases allow you to store and manage data that changes over time, and provide mechanisms for querying and analyzing this data based on its temporal properties. Temporal databases can be used to track changes to data over time, to identify trends and patterns in data, and to make predictions about future data based on past trends.

In a temporal database, each piece of data has an associated time range that indicates when it is valid or applicable. This time range can be either a timestamp (i.e., a specific point in time) or a time interval (i.e., a range of time). Temporal databases often provide specialized query languages and indexing techniques to allow for efficient retrieval and manipulation of temporal data.

Overall, temporal databases are a powerful tool for managing and analyzing temporal data, and are widely used in a variety of industries and applications.
